Please be advised this portfolio landing page was originally set up as a quick and minimal solution to share my projects and is not the truest reflection of my skills as a developer, so please check out the shared projects for a better idea of what I can do! 

Having said that, this page could use an update at this point, so I will plan to make it a more enjoyable and intriguing space in the coming weeks and months. Thank you for checking!
