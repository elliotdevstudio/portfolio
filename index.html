The design was originally done by the talented Nicole Wang Studio, and we're working to preserve it's former glory. I'm taking this opportunity to learn more complex and refined practices for creating better front-end results that are industry standard, and I hope this is one of many more projects to come that showcase my front-end ability and knowledge as I move further into full stack development.</br></br>

      <div class="project-description-container">
        <p class="description-text">This is a passion project currently in development, and was inspired by one of the difficulties I faced while running a restaurant. My objective is to create an additional feature for the 'Square' point-of-sale software using React and Recoil for state management, closely modeling the UX/UI that has contributed to its widespread popularity and with which I am highly familiar. It aims to solve a common problem for restaurant managers faced with the responsibility of distributing gratuities among different staff members who all contribute to the collective effort of providing great customer service. A CI/CD pipeline will be integrated at the time of deployment to enable a user to test the application in real-time. The image above is intended as a visual reference for the finalized iteration.

            <p class="description-text">This collaborative hackathon was hosted by General Assembly in May 2023, with a theme of 'Digital Equity and Accessiblity'. Our team of two developers and two UX/UI designers determined that the ubiquity and affordability of mobile smart devices opened some ground for exploring ideas, and with guidance of publicly available peer-reviewed research we concluded that our product should aim to assist individuals facing significant economic or housing challenges. To effectively manage the extensive range of desired components and functionalities, we focused on developing a minimum viable product (MVP) that included user authorization, a basic profile screen allowing users to create personal profiles, and a landing page featuring publicly accessible routes to various resources generated during our brainstorming sessions. For a few other additional endpoints that fell outside the scope of our project, we created mock-ups for presentation purposes, incorporating user interactions such as drop-down menus and basic animations. Our team was one of the smallest groups, after half of the initial participants needed to disengage. This was a great experience that challenged us on a professional level.</br></br>

This was a collaborative project done with one other GA classmate, with the goal of reverse engineering any part of a known or widely used application of our choosing. We went with the 'comments' functionality of 'Facebook', but given our constraints we decided to put together a simple app for sharing story prompts between interested writers who could then offer their feedback, hence the title. This is currently not a deployed project, but very soon everything posted in this section will have a properly working demo--and there will be more on the way!</br></br>

            <p class="description-text">"This was a group project I built with three other classmates, where we first simulated a scenario of working with a "client" (our instructor in disguise) and engaging in organized and throughtful discussions to fully understand the bigger picture of what they wanted. We were given prompts that lacked specificity, so our team brainstormed and prepared questions for two more follow up meetings that ultimately revealed the concept and user journey. In this case, our client desired a travel/interest application where users can create a profile, make posts, and share images to stir interest and community engagement around public art installations in their cities. This was done using Django, a relational database, a lot of experimental CSS that used customized Bootstrap, and it also required 'auth', CRUD functionality, and REST-ful routing.  </br></br>
